添加vscode终端的快捷别名

如下是在官网抄下来的：

> You can also run VS Code from the terminal by simply typing`code`.
>
> To set it up, launch VS Code. Then open the**Command Palette**\(⇧⌘P\) and type`shell command`to find the**Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH**command.
>
> Finally, restart the terminal for the new`$PATH`value to take effect. You'll be able to simply type`code .`in any folder to start editing files in that folder.

大致是进入VS Code,执行⇧⌘P,输入shell command,自动执行安装快捷alias.并且重启terminal\(zsh无需重启\)。
